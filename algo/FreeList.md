# Growable Freelist Implementation

This document details the growable freelist implementation tailored for high-performance applications that necessitate efficient memory management. The implementation is designed with a focus on minimizing overhead and optimizing for speed, using low-level system capabilities.

## Overview

The growable freelist manages memory allocation and deallocation for blocks of a fixed size, optimized to align with cache line sizes to mitigate cache misses. It dynamically allocates memory in chunks as needed, employing guard pages to trigger these allocations, thus minimizing its initial memory footprint.

### Features

- **Efficient Memory Allocation**: Employs `get` and `put` macros for rapid allocation and deallocation.
- **Cache Line Optimization**: Allows adjustment of block size to cache line size for enhanced performance.
- **Lazy Allocation**: Memory is allocated in segments on-demand, using guard pages to initiate allocation and reduce the initial memory footprint.
- **Exception-Based Extension**: Utilizes structured exception handling to manage dynamic memory allocation, ensuring robust operation.

### Design Considerations

- **Single-Threaded Use**: Due to static global parameters, this implementation does not inherently support multi-threading. It is designed for use in single-threaded applications or environments where external synchronization is provided.
- **Non-Volatile Register Usage**: Optimizes freelist access by utilizing a non-volatile register, which may influence the applicability of the freelist in certain contexts. Careful consideration is required to select an appropriate register that minimizes interference with other application components.

## Implementation Details

Implemented in FASM assembly language, the freelist leverages Windows APIs (`VirtualAlloc` and `VirtualFree`) and structured exception handling for memory management.

### Key Components

- **Initialization and Destruction**: Macros are provided for setting up and tearing down the freelist, including initial memory reservation and exception handler configuration.
- **Memory Block Management**: `get` and `put` macros facilitate the efficient handling of memory blocks, designed for minimal overhead.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Automatic extension of the freelist through committing additional memory pages as required, triggered by guard page access violations.

### Usage Guidelines

To utilize the freelist, initialize it at application startup and ensure its destruction before termination. Utilize the `get` macro for memory block allocation and the `put` macro for deallocation. Given the single-threaded design, it is crucial to manage access to the freelist appropriately in multi-threaded applications.

## Conclusion

This growable freelist implementation is crafted for high-performance, single-threaded applications requiring efficient dynamic memory management. Its design emphasizes minimizing overhead and optimizing cache utilization, making it a suitable choice for performance-critical applications in Windows environments.
