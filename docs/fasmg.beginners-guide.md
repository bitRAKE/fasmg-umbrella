## Beginner's Guide to flat assembler g

**Overall Tone:**  Friendly, encouraging, step-by-step, practical. Focus on "learning by doing."  Minimize jargon initially, explain concepts clearly and simply.  Use analogies where helpful.

**I. Welcome to fasm g! (Introduction)**

*   **What is Assembly Language?** (Very brief, high-level explanation for absolute beginners)
    *   The "lowest level" of programming, close to hardware.
    *   Why learn assembly? (Control, efficiency, understanding computer architecture).
    *   Briefly mention fasm g's strengths: speed, flexibility, macro power.
*   **Why fasm g?** (Specifically for this assembler)
    *   Fast assembly times.
    *   Powerful macro system (teaser, not deep dive yet).
    *   Cross-platform (mention if applicable - if not, focus on the target platform).
    *   Free and open-source.
*   **Who is this Guide For?**
    *   Beginners to assembly.
    *   Programmers curious about low-level programming.
    *   Anyone wanting to learn fasm g specifically.
*   **What You'll Learn:** (Brief overview of topics covered in the guide)
    *   Basic syntax, data definitions, symbols, expressions, control flow, macros (basic), output.
*   **What You'll Need:**
    *   Download fasm g (link to official site).
    *   Text editor.
    *   Command line/terminal access.

**II. Getting Started: Your First fasm g Program**

*   **Installation and Setup (Step-by-step):**
    *   Clear instructions for downloading and setting up fasm g on a common OS (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
    *   Simple command-line instructions.
    *   Verification step - how to run fasm g and check it's working.
*   **"Hello, World!" in fasm g (Example 1: Minimal):**
    ```assembly
    db 'Hello, World!', 0
    ```
    *   Explain each line simply: `db` (define byte), string literal.
    *   Assemble and run (basic command line).
    *   Focus on the *output* and the feeling of success.
*   **"Hello, World!" - Adding a Label (Example 2: Slightly More Structured):**
    ```assembly
    start:
        db 'Hello, World!', 0
    ```
    *   Introduce labels (`start:`).
    *   Explain that labels are names for memory locations.
    *   Re-assemble and run - show output is the same (reinforce labels are names, not code yet).

**III.  Understanding the Basics: Syntax and Data**

*   **Source Lines, Comments, and Tokens:**
    *   One command per line (basic rule).
    *   Comments (` ; `) - explain purpose.
    *   Tokens:
        *   Names (symbols, labels, instructions - introduce these terms gently).
        *   Numbers (decimal, hexadecimal `$`, binary `b` - focus on common ones first).
        *   Strings (single `'` and double `"` quotes - basic usage).
        *   Special Characters (introduce gradually as needed, don't overwhelm upfront).
*   **Defining Data: `db`, `dw`, and Friends:**
    *   `db` (define byte) - examples with numbers and strings.
    *   `dw` (define word - 16-bit) - introduce word size concept simply.
    *   Briefly mention `dd` (dword - 32-bit) and others (refer to table in the manual later, but don't detail all now).
    *   `dup` (duplicate) - simple repetition examples.
    *   `?` (uninitialized data) - basic concept of reserving space.
*   **Numbers in fasm g:**
    *   Decimal, Hexadecimal (`$`, `h`, `0x`), Binary (`b`), Octal (`o`, `q`).
    *   Examples of each format.
    *   Simple arithmetic with numbers (preview for expressions).

**IV. Symbols and Variables: Naming Your World**

*   **Labels (`:`):**
    *   Reiterate: Names for memory locations.
    *   Used for jumping (mention control flow coming later).
    *   Example: Simple data section with labels.
*   **Variables (`=` and `:=`):**
    *   `=` for variables (reassignable values).
    *   `:=` for constants (fixed values).
    *   Difference between labels and variables (key distinction).
    *   Simple examples of variable assignment and use.
*   **Case Sensitivity (and `?` modifier):**
    *   Default is case-sensitive.
    *   `?` for case-insensitive symbols (example and when it's useful - e.g., built-in names).
*   **Namespaces (Introduction - Keep it Simple initially):**
    *   Briefly introduce the concept of organizing symbols (like folders for files).
    *   `.` for child namespaces (basic example - `my_struct.field`).
    *   `.` for recent label namespace (very basic example).
    *   *Defer* `namespace` command and complex dot notation for a later, "Intermediate Guide" if needed.

**V.  Working with Data: Expressions and Operators**

*   **Expressions: Combining Values:**
    *   Explain how to combine numbers, symbols, and operators to calculate values.
    *   Order of operations (briefly mention precedence, parentheses).
*   **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`):**
    *   Simple examples of each operator in expressions.
    *   Focus on integer arithmetic for now.
*   **Bitwise Operators (`and`, `or`, `xor`, `not`, `shl`, `shr`):**
    *   Introduce bitwise operations with simple, practical examples (e.g., masking bits, shifting for multiplication/division by powers of 2).
    *   Visual aids (bit patterns) if helpful.
*   **String Operators (`lengthof`, `bappend`, `string`, `+` (string to number)):**
    *   Basic string operations (length, concatenation).
    *   Conversion between strings and numbers (briefly).

**VI.  Controlling the Flow: Conditional Assembly and Repetition**

*   **Conditional Assembly (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `end if`):**
    *   Basic `if` statement with a simple condition (e.g., comparing numbers).
    *   `else if` and `else` for branching.
    *   Logical operators (`&`, `|`, `~` - introduce gradually).
    *   Practical examples: different data based on a setting, enabling/disabling features.
*   **Repeating Blocks (`repeat`, `end repeat`, `%`):**
    *   `repeat` for simple loops (fixed number of iterations).
    *   `%` for repetition counter (example: generating a table of values).
    *   `break` (briefly introduce for early loop exit).
*   **`while` loop (introduction):**
    *   Basic `while` loop based on a condition.
    *   Simple examples where `while` is more suitable than `repeat`.
    *   *Defer* `iterate`, `irpv`, `indx` for a later "Advanced Techniques" section.

**VII.  Basic Macroinstructions: Code Reusability**

*   **What are Macros? (Simple Explanation):**
    *   Code templates - ways to reuse code blocks with variations.
    *   `macro` and `end macro` for defining macros.
    *   Macro name as a new "instruction."
*   **Macros with Parameters (Basic):**
    *   Simple macro with one or two parameters.
    *   Parameter substitution (how values are inserted into macro code).
    *   Example: Macro to define a byte with a comment, macro to define a word.
*   **Using Macros in Your Code:**
    *   Calling a macro - just like any other instruction.
    *   Passing arguments to macros.
*   **Keep it Simple for Beginners:**
    *   *Avoid* local variables in macros initially.
    *   *Defer* complex macro features (recursion, `esc`, `!`, etc.) to an "Advanced Macros" section if needed.

**VIII.  Organizing Output: Output Areas (`org`, Basic `virtual`)**

*   **Output Areas: Controlling Memory Layout:**
    *   Explain that assembly generates machine code placed in memory.
    *   `org` (origin) - setting the starting address for output.
    *   Example: Two simple `org` areas to place data at different addresses.
*   **Basic `virtual` Areas (Introduction):**
    *   `virtual` and `end virtual` for defining data that *doesn't* go into the main output (for calculations, temporary data).
    *   Simple example of using `virtual` for a lookup table.
    *   *Defer* `section`, `load`, `store`, `restartout`, and advanced `virtual` features for a later "Output Control" section.

**IX. Putting It All Together: A Slightly Larger Example Program**

*   **Choose a Simple, Demonstrative Project:**
    *   Example:  "Simple Data Table Generator" - program to create a table of squares or Fibonacci numbers in memory.
    *   Example: "Basic Text Display" - program to display a short message on a (simulated or platform-specific) display.
    *   Example: "Simple Calculator (non-interactive)" - program to perform a few calculations and store results in memory.
*   **Walkthrough the Code Step-by-Step:**
    *   Explain the purpose of each section.
    *   Highlight how different fasm g features are used together (data definitions, symbols, expressions, loops, macros if used).
    *   Assemble and run the example.
*   **Encourage Experimentation:**
    *   Suggest modifications to the example program to encourage users to try things out and learn by doing.

**X.  Next Steps and Further Learning**

*   **Where to Go From Here in the Manual:**
    *   Guide users to the more detailed sections of the full manual (now they have a foundation).
    *   Suggest specific sections to explore next based on their interests (macros, output control, CALM instructions - if appropriate).
*   **Other Resources:**
    *   Links to fasm g website, forums, online communities (if any).
    *   General assembly language learning resources (if relevant).
*   **Practice Makes Perfect:**
    *   Encourage users to write their own small fasm g programs to solidify their understanding.
    *   Suggest simple project ideas to try.

**XI. Troubleshooting and Common Beginner Errors**

    *   Typos in instruction names or keywords.
    *   Incorrect number formats.
    *   Missing commas or separators.
    *   Unbalanced quotes or parentheses.
*   **Symbol and Label Errors:**
    *   Undefined symbols (typos, forgetting to define).
    *   Redefinition errors (labels defined multiple times - emphasize labels are *unique*).
    *   Forward reference issues (basic explanation - symbol used before definition).
*   **Command Line Errors:**
    *   Incorrect fasm g command syntax.
    *   File not found errors.
    *   Output file issues (permissions, etc.).
