*Tale* is the Afrikaans word for languages, and in English is an imaginatively recounted story. Here I explore various techniques to build multi-lingual applications in fasmg. Due to my naivet√© in both spoken/written languages and prior work I've seen in this area programmatically; I'm just going to start with the simplest methods I can think of.

I only know English, so the translation is via the internet.
(Checked some of them with google translate.)

Currently, the demo menu builds in 14 languages (alphabetically):

- Bengali
- Chinese
- English
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Hindi
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Russian

Obviously, other languages or refinements are welcome.

Translating the words is just the start of localization. Other cultural factors should also be concidered which might only be known by peoples of the region. Effecting this example, would be keyboard shortcuts or maybe slang terms exist which are more perferred.


There are a number of ISO standards regarding abbreviating languages and countries
	[ISO 639-1/2/3][0]
	[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2][1]

I've chosen to use a 2+2 syntax to represent language and region spoken. This might be completely in error or insufficient. As I learn more perhaps this will change.



#### Inquiring with GPT-4 as to reasons for translating software:

While it is true that English is widely used in technology and many people around the world have some level of proficiency in English, it is still important to consider translating software into native languages. Here are some reasons why:

1. Accessibility: Not everyone is proficient in English or comfortable using software in a language that is not their native tongue. By translating software into native languages, you can make it more accessible to a broader audience, allowing people who might not speak English to use your software with ease.

2. Better user experience: Providing software in a user's native language can significantly enhance their experience. It helps them understand the features and functionalities better, which can lead to increased satisfaction and higher engagement.

3. Localization: Localization goes beyond just translating the language; it also takes into account cultural differences and local preferences. By localizing your software, you can ensure that it is tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of users in different countries and regions.

4. Competitive advantage: Offering software in multiple languages can give you a competitive edge, especially in markets where English is not the primary language. This can help you reach new customers and expand your user base.

5. Legal requirements: In some countries and regions, there may be legal requirements for software to be available in the local language. By translating your software, you can ensure compliance with these regulations.
