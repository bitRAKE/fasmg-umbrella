
#### In-Tale - Building for multiple languages.

*Tale* is the Afrikaans word for languages, and in English is an imaginatively recounted story. Here I explore various techniques to build multi-lingual applications in fasmg. Due to my naivet√© in both spoken/written languages and prior work in this area programmatically; I'm just going to start with the simplest methods I can think of.

I only know English, so the translation is via the internet.
(Checked some of them with google translate.)

Currently, the demo menu builds in 12 languages (alphabetically):

- Chinese
- English
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Russian

Obviously, other languages or refinements are welcome.
